# Godot 2D action adventure platformer demo modified

Godot 2D action adventure platformer demo will be a "complete" tiny demo that should contains a lot of useful stuffs for people that want to learn [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) and creating their own platformer. 

I hope it should answer the common question : _Damn, how can I code that ?_ by only reading through code instead.
